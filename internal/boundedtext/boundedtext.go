// Package boundedtext renders a string or an error at a length that does not
// depend on the input that produced it.
//
// It exists because usage-store has no auth and listens on every interface, so
// the length of a 400 body was the caller's to choose. Measured against the
// deployed binary on :8185 with a 5 000-byte occurred_at_str:
//
//	POST /api/usage/spend/topups   10 096 bytes   before
//	                                  ~110        after
//
// The amplification is time.Parse's, not this repo's. time.Parse quotes its
// whole input back inside its own error and does it twice:
//
//	parsing time "xxx…" as "2006-01-02": cannot parse "xxx…" as "2006"
//
// So err.Error() is already 2x the input before any statement here adds to it,
// and a statement that also prints the value with %q is 3x. Both halves have to
// be bounded: cutting the value alone leaves the wrapped parser error carrying
// two full copies, and the truncate call sitting there then reads exactly like a
// bound that holds.
//
// The error is worth carrying at its realistic length rather than dropping. For
// an ordinary bad date it says something the value alone does not — "month out
// of range", "day out of range", "extra text" — and every such diagnosis this
// repo's callers can produce fits inside errorLimit.
