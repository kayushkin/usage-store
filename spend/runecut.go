// Cutting a Go string at a fixed byte offset splits whatever rune straddles
// that offset, and the result is not valid UTF-8. Nothing reports it:
// encoding/json substitutes U+FFFD rather than returning an error, so a reader
// of :8185 sees a replacement character and no error is raised anywhere along
// the path.
//
// These two carry the semantics settled for the fleet unicode byte-cut sweep.
// The canonical pair is tool-store's schema.TruncateAtRuneBoundary and
// schema.SuffixAtRuneBoundary; usage-store keeps a package-local copy rather
// than importing tool-store, because a 20-line helper is not worth a module
// edge from the spend collector to the tool registry. The names and the
// behaviour are the canonical ones so the copies cannot drift apart silently.
//
// The walk costs at most three byte comparisons and allocates nothing, which is
// why it is preferred here over converting to []rune.

// truncateAtRuneBoundary returns the longest prefix of s that is no longer than
// maxBytes and does not end part-way through a multi-byte UTF-8 sequence.

//
// This is the other half of the defect and it walks the opposite way. A prefix
// cut leaves the leading bytes of a straddling rune at the end of the result;
// a suffix cut leaves its trailing continuation bytes at the start. Walking
// back would lengthen the suffix past its budget, so the cut moves forward and
// drops the partial rune.
