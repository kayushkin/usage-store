"""Score usage-store's tests for the spend-keys mechanism by breaking it.

The scoring engine — and the rules it enforces as refusals — lives in
scripts/sabotage.py. This file is only the case list: one edit per mechanism
the suite is meant to pin.

    python3 scripts/sabotage-spend-keys.py [--diffs] [--crosstable]

⚠️ **This is the engine's SEVENTH copy, and it is the same blob as the other
six.** md5 `9a81a32e5827b59c1a3093bf88187b17`, taken from git blob
`664f35f475edb9b7d018a28136211bf58a0ff53e` — what
`scheduler/fix/the-scorer-counts-occurrences-not-files`,
`bundle-store/docs/one-sabotage-engine-again`,
`agent-store/test/the-tracked-file-switch-is-unreached`,
`skill-store/test/the-install-path-is-unreached`,
`tool-store/test/the-repo-map-and-recent-files-tools-are-unreached` and
`mailstack/test/the-write-ops-are-unreached` all carry. Diff before editing; an
eighth blob is a fork. Take the blob off the BRANCH, not out of a working tree —
those checkouts sit on whatever branch their last pass left them on, and
md5summing them answers about the wrong commit (221st).

Why this seam is worth a scorer: measured on `main`, a `panic()` on the first
line of any of these twenty-three left `go test ./...` green. Only
`migrateSpend` reddened, and only because `Open` runs it.

The census named ONE of the twenty-three. That is the sixth consecutive row on
`e9b0b89c` where the function name under-described the mechanism it belongs to,
and the 222nd's rule — read the row's neighbours before scoping the work to its
title — has now not once failed to pay.

⚠️ Read that measurement on `main`. usage-store's checkout was standing on
`test/auth-store-clients-speak-the-real-protocol`, which is exactly the base the
223rd's rule is about: a reach guard run on whatever branch a checkout was left
on answers about the wrong tree, and it fails in the direction that closes a row
without testing it. This branch is cut from `main`.

Result, 2026-08-15: **70/74 real mechanisms caught, both controls behaved.** The
four uncaught rows are all declared below with their reasons — three are guards
dominated by their own callee or by a conversion that no input can separate from
its absence, and one is a copy that exists to show what the assertions do NOT
rest on. Round one scored lower with three `compile error` rows and one abort:
every compile error was a case that DELETED a value another line still used, and
the abort was `w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNoContent)`, which appears in the delete
handler and in the preflight branch both.

What makes this mechanism worth more than a coverage row: it is the only code in
the fleet whose output is money the user is deciding by. Two figures on one
response are computed by different routes through the store — the window totals
are accumulated key by key while walking `ListKeyMeta`, and the balance is a
single provider-wide sum — so they can disagree without either being obviously
wrong. Sixteen of the cases below are about which day, which key and which
deposit each of them counts.
